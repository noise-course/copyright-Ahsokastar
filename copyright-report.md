# Platform Analysis

I chose to use X as my platform.

How does the platform detect copyrighted content?:
X detects copyrighted content via DMCA manual reporting. The copyright holder, or someone who is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner needs to submit the following things

<img width="699" height="587" alt="copyright-report-docs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/911d7e45-42a3-424f-bdb9-c87824b0e301" />

What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?

If the content is flagged as potentially infringing, X will send the complainant an acknowledgement that they have created a ticket. Then if X decides to take action and remove the content they will notify the person who posted the content and send them a copy of the report. They also provide counter-notice instructions to the user who had their post taken down.

What is the appeals or counter-notification process?

X states that users who have their content removed may want to reach out to the complainant to seek their retraction. Alternatively, a user can submit a counter notice complaint which X notes is a legal step with legal ramifications. The following information needs to be submitted for a counter-notice:

<img width="702" height="655" alt="counter-notice" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f856d78a-595a-45f7-88e9-37e4e507229d" />

After the counter notice is filed, X will share the counter notice with the person who submitted the copyright infringement complaint. Then the complaintant can take legal action against the potential infringer, and if they do not do so in 10 days, X may reinstate the post in question.

How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?

X doesn't have a specific policy for the monetization of copyrighted material specifically. The process is the same as the process I described above. X does have a monetization of content policy, but it does not discuss copyright. It can be found here: https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/content-monetization-standards

Are there any special programs?

None that I saw in my research.

#  Fair Use Experiments

## Content 1

I uploaded a 5 second clip of Newsies from Disney Plus. Proof is below.

This was not detected as copyrighted content. I saw no warnings or flags. I uploaded it at 12:39pm PT on December 11, and no action has been taken against the content.

## Content 2

I uploaded a 30 second clip of Newsies from Disney plus and added audio on top of it with an educational script about the real newsboys strike of 1899. Proof of upload is below.

This was not detected as copyrighted content. I saw no warnings or flags. I uploaded it at 1:01pm PT on December 11, and no action has been taken against the content.

What does the AI tool's terms of service say about copyright?
The OpenAI terms of use say that if you think your intellectual rights were infringed upon then you can submit a complaint with the following information and they may remove the content:

Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content?
No one owns the copyfright for any fully AI works.

What is your platform's stated policy on AI-generated content:
AI generated content is allowed as long as it is not something "that may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety, or cause serious harm" from: https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/authenticity

# Legal Analysis

Purpose and character of the use (transformative? commercial?)
- The 5 second clip did not transform the content at all, the use was not commercial though
- The longer clip did transform the clip as it added educational content to it through the voice over. Additionally the use was clearly educational
Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
- The 5 second clip was mainly creative as it was a video of a Broadway Musical
- The longer clip was also mainly creative as it was a video of a Broadway Musical
Amount and substantiality used
- 5 seconds (Out of 2.5 hours)
- 30 seconds (Out of 2.5 hours)
Effect on the market for the original
- Very small because it is not a substantial enough clip for it to reduce the desire for people to watch the whole thing. Additionally it would be surprising if anyone purchased access to Disney+ solely for the reason of watching Newsies.; Applies to both postings

## Gap Analysis

The only gaps I noticed were in OpenAI's ability to determine what was copyrighted or not. It refused to make two images in the style of a copyrighted work but then complied with my final request to make an image in the style of something. This makes it unclear what is or is not allowed from the platform.

As far as I know, my content has not been reported on X, and it has not been removed without a notification to me, which seems to follow the policy. I also believe copyright law is being followed here, as my usage of copyrighted content is probably small enough that it would fall under fair use.

AI Prompts:
In addition to the AI prompts I cited above I also asked "give me a 30 second educational script about the news strike that newsies is about" because I wanted to have some information to make my fair use video.
