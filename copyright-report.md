# Platform Analysis

I chose to use X as my platform.

How does the platform detect copyrighted content?:
X detects copyrighted content via DMCA manual reporting. The copyright holder, or someone who is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner needs to submit the following things

What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?

If the content is flagged as potentially infringing, X will send the complainant an acknowledgement that they have created a ticket. Then if X decides to take action and remove the content they will notify the person who posted the content and send them a copy of the report. They also provide counter-notice instructions to the user who had their post taken down.

What is the appeals or counter-notification process?

X states that users who have their content removed may want to reach out to the complainant to seek their retraction. Alternatively, a user can submit a counter notice complaint which X notes is a legal step with legal ramifications. The following information needs to be submitted for a counter-notice:

After the counter notice is filed, X will share the counter notice with the person who submitted the copyright infringement complaint. Then the complaintant can take legal action against the potential infringer, and if they do not do so in 10 days, X may reinstate the post in question.

How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?

X doesn't have a specific policy for the monetization of copyrighted material specifically. The process is the same as the process I described above. X does have a monetization of content policy, but it does not discuss copyright. It can be found here: https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/content-monetization-standards

Are there any special programs?

None that I saw in my research.
